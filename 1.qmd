# Camille's Recomndataions

## Roleplay

 students have now learned about how firms act when engaging in IB; they should apply and test this knowledge in roleplay situations; professor evaluates how effective their choices are and whether this accurately reflects real decisions.

### Interactive trade or market entry game

 Turn international market analysis into a competitive activity where teams act as firms choosing where to expand. Each country option has different risk-reward profiles (tariffs, cultural barriers, supply chain complexity), and teams justify their choices. Makes theoretical frameworks more tangible. Acts as a low-stakes preliminary activity for final project - gets students acquainted with this, may assist them in ideation or execution of this project.


### International crisis response simulation

 Present a scenario involving a sudden geopolitical, economic, or health-related disruption. Students take on roles (e.g., regional director, risk analyst, COO) and collaborate to draft a real-time global adaptation strategy (encourages fast thinking and practical problem-solving.


### Final Project - International Expansion Case

Objective: Apply strategic analysis tools to identify and solve a companyâ€™s core business challenges within an international context, resulting in a recommendation that addresses both firm-specific and global market dynamics

### Notes & suggestions:

- Rubric could include section on presentation of case report (eg. visuals, organization of information, logical flow of report).
- Could include contingency analysis: missing a risk assessment and plan to mitigate potential challenges.
- Important to consider how implementation would vary under conditions of different nations (political situation, tastes, social & economic factors)
